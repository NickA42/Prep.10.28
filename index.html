    THE WORKS OF INNER JOIN
    </h1>
    <p>
    INNER JOIN is a code in SQL (Structured Query Language) that combines the same information in more than one table into a single table. 
    To be more precise, if there are two different tables in the same database that have a certain customer who 
    bought an item online and in-store, you can find those same items by using an INNER JOIN function. The INNER 
    JOIN function would connect the two tables like a compare and contrast chart.

    Data Science vs. Computer Science
    </h1>
    <p>
   Data Science and Computer Science seem like a similar subject when looking on the outside but Data Science involves a lot more 
   than just computer science. Data Science involves many different variables that computer science does not have. 
   In data science you are subject to analyzing data, figuring out the issues with the data and creating an algorithm to 
   find or edit certain data sets to make them more efficient. For example, Netflix, with the help of 5 data scientists created an algorithm
   to fetch out the user's recommended movies and tv shows based on what they previously watched. Data science is a combination of Business 
   Intelligence and Computer science, using both to understand and create algorithms that overall benefit the company or base you are working for.
   Data Scientists ask questions about the problem, think of ways to solve it and then creates many algorithms to try and solve the issue. 
   Computer science is not a lot about analyzing data but more of creating your own and making things out of nothing. Data Scientists need
   data to actually do work. I guess in some cases a computer scientist would also need a database to work from but not all. So in short, a data
   scientist is a lot less of a computer scientist than most think, they don't need a strong background in comp. sci. to do that.
